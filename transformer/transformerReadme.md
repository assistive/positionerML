Why Transformers for Drowsiness Detection
While your RNN with bi-directional LSTM excels at smoothing IMU data, Transformers offer distinct advantages for drowsiness detection:

Superior Long-Range Dependencies: Transformers can directly model connections between distant time points through self-attention, capturing subtle long-term drowsiness patterns that LSTMs might miss.
Parallel Processing: Unlike sequential RNNs, Transformers process entire sequences simultaneously, offering potential speed improvements.
Attention Visualization: The attention mechanism provides interpretable insights into which time segments most strongly indicate drowsiness.
Multi-scale Pattern Recognition: Transformers can simultaneously detect patterns at different time scales (seconds, minutes) relevant for drowsiness.


Training Strategy

Two-phase training approach:

First, train the transformer backbone on general IMU sequence prediction tasks
Then, fine-tune with task-specific heads for accident and drowsiness detection


Use progressive learning:

Start with distinguishing extreme events (severe crashes, very drowsy driving)
Gradually refine to detect subtler events (near-misses, mild drowsiness)


Use transfer learning:

If limited labeled data, pretrain on your existing position prediction task
Fine-tune on the specific detection tasks
